"The assassination (of Uriel Septim VII) is now known to have been the work of a group of daedric cultists known as the Mythic Dawn. (Those who still suspect the Dark Brotherhood should consider two facts: first, they would have only needed a single assassin, not a small army of them; second, the Dark Brotherhood would never be so foolish as to effectively declare war on the Empire and thus ensure their complete destruction."

I am curious about this line. Is it subtle foreshadowing of the Destroy the Dark Brotherhood! quest in Skyrim (since the player is given the quest by Maro and TLDB is the only assassin needed to kill the Emperor) or does it go to show just how weak the Empire has become (the scratches and damage on the Skyrim cover, Talos ban, White Gold Concordat)?

I always thought that the Dark Brotherhood questline in Skyrim didn't make much sense when playing a Legionary. Why does the Game expect you to kill your own Emperor? Saying that, it wouldn't make much sense for a Stormcloak either. The Emperor comes to Skyrim after the Empire have lost the Civil War, and Gaius Maro walks into Windhelm unscathed. The DB questline in Skyrim makes little to no sense, which leads me to believe that Destroy the Dark Brotherhood! is canon, which makes me sad.
